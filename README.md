<h4>Change Log</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Enemies now die correctly</li>
</ul>

<h4>Issues</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Camera shakes during linear movement. Note: Is being caused during collisions. Can be replicated after the first time a spell is spawned. Camera always shakes at this point, meaning the player's position is being altered.</li>
</ul>
